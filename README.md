PUBLIC BETA NOTICE
------------------

OpenTimelineIO is currently in Public Beta. That means that it may be missing
some essential features and there are large changes planned. During this phase
we actively encourage you to provide feedback, requests, comments, and/or
contributions.

NOTE: One of these missing features is support for the downgrade versioning
map in the JSON serialization and deserialization. This can be addressed in
the future, but for now an empty map is passed to the underlying C++ calls.

Overview
--------

OpenTimelineIO is an interchange format and API for editorial cut information.
OTIO is not a container format for media, rather it contains information about
the order and length of cuts and references to external media. This repository 
contains the Java bindings built over the C++ core which you can find [here](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO).

OTIO includes both a file format and an API for manipulating that format.
It also implements a dependency-less library for dealing strictly with time, `opentime`.

You can provide adapters for your video editing tool or pipeline as needed.

The OpenTimelineIO core is written in C++. This repository hosts C bindings for OpenTimelineIO.

Prerequisites
-----------

- CMake 3.17.0+ (Windows) or CMake 3.9.4+ (Linux and macOS)
- Compiler with C++11 support

Dependencies
-----------

- [OpenTimelineIO](http://opentimeline.io/): OpenTimelineIO-C-Bindings is a C-wrapper over the OpenTimelineIO C++ core
- [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/): It is a unit testing framework for C used here to test the bindings.

Building OpenTimelineIO-C-Bindings
------------------------

OpenTimelineIO-C-Bindings have been built and tested on Ubuntu 18.04LTS, Windows 10 and macOS.
Follow these instructions to build the C bindings.

```console
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenTimelineIO/OpenTimelineIO-C-Bindings

cd OpenTimelineIO-C-Bindings

mkdir build

cd build

cmake .. {CMAKE OPTIONS}

cmake --build . --config {Debug/Release}
```

To run the tests from the `build` directory run:
```console
ctest
```

| CMAKE OPTION               | VALID VALUES |                                                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX       | {SOME PATH}  | Install the libs to this path (`usr/lib/` by default on Linux/macOS) |
| COTIO_INSTALL              | ON/OFF       | Install the C bindings (ON by default)                               |
| COTIO_SHARED_LIBS          | ON/OFF       | Build shared if ON, static if OFF (OFF by default)                    |
| COTIO_AUTOMATIC_SUBMODULES | ON/OFF       | Fetch submodules automatically (ON by default)                       |


Examples
--------

Looking through the unit tests is a great way to see what OTIO can do. 
See [here](https://github.com/OpenTimelineIO/OpenTimelineIO-C-Bindings/tree/master/tests).
